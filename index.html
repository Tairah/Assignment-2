   <h2 style="text-align:center;">Timeline:</h2>
   <ul>
  <li>1941: Dennis Ritchie was born on September 9th, 1941 in Bronxville, New York.</li>
  <li>1967: In 1967, Ritchie began to work at Bell Labs. Here, he worked with a man named Kenneth Thompson and they began to work on a project called the Unix.</li>
  <li>In 1968, Ritchie graduated from Harvard University with degrees in Mathematics and Physics. He earned his PhD with a thesis about "Program Structure and Computational Complexity".</li>
  <li>1969: Bell Labs decides to remove themselves from the Multics operating system project that Ritchie and Thompson were working together on. Ritchie aided Thompson in producing this single-memory operating system.</li>
  <li>On November 3rd, 1971, Ritchie and Thompson release the UNIX operating system. The UNIX was a multiuser operating system that was able to function on a variety of platforms and totally changed technology forever.</li>
  <li>1973: Because the UNIX was written in machine language, Ritchie worked endlessly to create a language that simplified the system, as well as make it more accessible. Then "C" Language was created.</li>
  <li>1974: Ritchie received an award for his work on his paper about his languages and systems regarding the UNIX.</li>
  <li>In 1982, Ritchie and Thompson were awarded the IEEE Emmanuel Piore Award.</li>
  <li>1983: He and Thompson also got awarded the A.M.Turing an award due to the development of their generic operating system theory, specifically the UNIX operating system.</li>
  <li>1983: Both again, they received an award for their generic operating systems theory and their UNIX operating system.</li>
  <li>In 1988, Ritchie was elected into the United States National Academy of Engineering.</li>
  <li>1990: Ritchie is promoted to leader of the Computing Techniques Research Department at Lucent Technologies (previously known as Bell Labs).</li>
  <li>In 1994, Ritchie is awarded the Computer Pioneer Award for his contribution to the UNIX operating system.</li>
  <li>In 1995, Ritchie released the Plan 9 operating system. Along with his team, he worked to integrate graphics and forms of networking into the UNIX operating system, which is known as Plan 9.</li>
  <li>1996: The Inferno Operating System was developed by Dennis Ritchie on behalf of Bell Labs. The operating system was a distributed operating system as free software.</li>
  <li>1999: Ritchie and Thompson are recognized by current president, Bill Clinton, for their work on the UNIX operating system as well as their work on the "C" programming language.</li>
  <li>Then, on October 12th in 2011, Dennis Ritchie passes away in Berkeley Heights, NJ.</li>
</ul>  

<h2 style="text-align:center;">Facts:</h2>
   <ul>
  <li> He created the C programming language and, with long-time colleague Ken Thompson, the UNIX operating system. </li>

  <li>And the Hamming Medal from the IEEE in 1990 and the National Medal of Technology from President Clinton in 1999.</li>
  <li>Ritchie was the head of Lucent Technologies System Software Research Department when he retired in 2007. </li>
  <li>He was the 'R' in K&R C.</li>
  <li>He receive his PhD under the supervision of Patrick C.</li>
   <li>Dennis Ritchie attended Harvard and graduated with degrees in Physics and Applied Mathematics.</li>
    <li>He is best known as the creator of the C programming language.</li>
     <li>He was also the co-author of the book the C programming language</li>
